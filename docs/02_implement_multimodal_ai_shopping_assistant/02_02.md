# Task 02 - Create a multi-agent solution

## Introduction

Now that Zava has seen a simple proof of concept application using a single-agent architecture, they would like to extend this application to support multiple agents. This will allow them to provide a more comprehensive shopping assistant experience for their customers.

## Description

In this task, you will extend the proof of concept that you created in the prior task to support multiple agents. You will create these agents in Microsoft Foundry and integrate them into your chat application. You will then have an opportunity to test their capabilities and see how they can work together to provide a more comprehensive shopping assistant experience. You will also leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable richer interactions between the agents and the tools they use.

## Success Criteria

- You have created relevant agents in Microsoft Foundry.
- You have updated the chat application to support these agents.

## Learning Resources

- [Azure AI Agents function calling](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/function-calling?pivots=python)
- [What are tools in Microsoft Foundry Agent Service?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/overview)

## Key Tasks

### 01: Create an agent

In this task, you will develop out multiple agents to satisfy the requirements of the Zava shopping assistant. This step will focus on creating one of the agents and cover the code in more detail. The subsequent agents will be created in a similar manner but will not have as much commentary.

<details markdown="block">

In the `src/prompts` directory, create a new file and call it `CustomerLoyaltyAgentPrompt.txt`. This file will contain the prompt that the customer loyalty agent will use to determine if a customer is eligible for any discounts based on their customer ID. Add the following text to the file:

```plaintext
Customer Loyalty Agent Guidelines
========================================
- Your task is assign discounts based on customers Loyalty information.Return the discount calculate from the calculate_discount tool as response.
- Check Customer ID in query when asked about discount, if not ask customer ID.
- Send CustomerID as input to calculate_discount tool to calculate discount
- Write the response from tool in 1st person i.e (Congratulations! You are eligible for.. thankyou..) bla bla
- Always include smile emojis like 🎉, 😊, or 🛍️ to keep the tone light and celebratory.
- Example message(keep changing) : Hey there, Bruno! 🎉 \n Great news—you just scored an exclusive 20% off your order! \nTreat yourself and enjoy your special savings at checkout. Thanks for being awesome! 🙌
- In your answer do not mention e.g. word instead use Example, such as or like based on the sentence.

- Return response in following json format

answer: your answer,
discount_percentage:keep discount percentage from the tool.

Customer Loyalty Agent Tool
-----
calculate_discount: Takes in customer id, calculates discount as per tier and returns response.

Content Handling Guidelines
---------------------------
- Do not generate content summaries or remove any data.
```

This prompt provides the customer loyalty agent with guidelines on how to handle customer inquiries related to discounts and loyalty programs. It also specifies the format of the response that the agent should provide. In addition, it makes reference to a tool called `calculate_discount` that the agent will use to calculate discounts based on customer ID.

Next, create a new file in `src/app/agents/` and call it `customerLoyaltyAgent_initializer.py`. This file will contain the code to create the customer loyalty agent in Microsoft Foundry. Add the following code to the top of the file:

```python
import os
import sys
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))))
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.agents.models import ToolSet
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agent_processor import create_function_tool_for_agent
from agent_initializer import initialize_agent

load_dotenv()
```

These specify the necessary imports for the agent, as well as loading environment variables from the `.env` file.

Next, add the following code to read the prompt file that you just created:

```python
CL_PROMPT_TARGET = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))), 'prompts', 'CustomerLoyaltyAgentPrompt.txt')
with open(CL_PROMPT_TARGET, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    CL_PROMPT = file.read()
```

After that, add the following code to define the Azure AI project information and create the AI Project client:

```python
project_endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_AI_AGENT_ENDPOINT"]

project_client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=project_endpoint,
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
)
```

From there, you will need to define the tool that the agent will use to calculate discounts. Add the following code:

```python
# Define the set of user-defined callable functions to use as tools (from MCP client)
functions = create_function_tool_for_agent("customer_loyalty")
toolset = ToolSet()
toolset.add(functions)
project_client.agents.enable_auto_function_calls(tools=functions)
```

This makes reference to a function called `create_function_tool_for_agent()` in `src/app/agents/agent_processor.py`. This function takes in an agent type and defines the functions that particular agent will use. In this case, it defines the `mcp_calculate_discount()` function as a tool for the customer loyalty agent. This function calls `get_customer_discount()`, which finally calls `calculate_discount()` in `src/app/tools/discountLogic.py`. This function takes a customer ID and returns a discount percentage based on the customer's loyalty tier. You can review the code in this file to understand how it works. This particular tool is more complex than others because it communicates with the GPT model to determine the appropriate discount based on the customer's transaction history. It also simulates connecting to two separate databases to retrieve customer information.

Finally, add the following code to create the customer loyalty agent in Microsoft Foundry:

```python
initialize_agent(
    project_client=project_client,
    model=os.environ["AZURE_AI_AGENT_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"],
    env_var_name="customer_loyalty",
    name="Zava Customer Loyalty Agent",
    instructions=CL_PROMPT,
    toolset=toolset
)
```

This code initializes the agent with the specified model, name, instructions, and toolset. It then creates the agent in Microsoft Foundry and prints the agent ID to the console. You will need to add the agent ID to the `.env` file later.

</details>

### 02: Create remaining agents

Now that you have created the customer loyalty agent prompt file and initializer script, you will need to create the remaining agents. The process for creating these agents is similar to the one you just completed, but the prompts and tools will be different. The following four blocks include the prompt and code for each of the remaining agents.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the interior design agent</strong></summary>

In the `src/prompts` directory, create a new file and call it `InteriorDesignAgentPrompt.txt`. Add the following text to the file:

```plaintext
Interior Design Agent Guidelines
========================================
- You are a Interior Designer sales person working for Zava and help customers who need help in DIY Projects and other interior design queries
- Your main tasks are the following: recommending and upselling products, creating images
- You will get input in the form of a json, having:

    {
        "Conversation_history":the Conversation thats going on,
        "image_url": Image based on which you need to recreate some image
        "image_description": If there is an image attached, the description or it will be empty
        "products_available": A list of products, from where you can give recommendations
        "user_last_query": The last query from user
    }
]
- You will always recommend product from the products_available.
- You will keep asking questions to the user and keep recommending.
- When you get an image, reply saying "I see you uploaded..."
- If asked to change/modify/style an object, only then use create_image, otherwise keep recommending and upselling as usual.
- In your answer do not mention e.g. word instead use Example, such as or like based on the sentence.

Return response in following json format

answer: your answer,
image_output: if there, otherwise empty
products: [
  {
    "id": "<ProductID>",
    "name": "<ProductName>",

    "imageURL": "<ImageURL>",
    "punchLine": "<ProductPunchLine>",
    "price": "<FormattedPriceWithDollarSign>"
  }, {..}
  ...
]


Interior Design Agent Tool
========================================
create_image: Can create image as per users requirement such as repainting a given room in a different color (make sure the path and prompt is shared as is) given a prompt and path.

<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the cart manager agent</strong></summary>

In the `src/prompts` directory, create a new file and call it `CartManagerPrompt.txt`. Add the following text to the file:

```plaintext
You are a Cart Manager Assistant for Zava, a home improvement and furniture retailer.

Your primary responsibilities:

1. CART MANAGEMENT
   - Add products to the customer's shopping cart
   - Remove products from the cart
   - Update product quantities
   - Clear the entire cart when requested
   - Provide cart summaries and totals

2. CART OPERATIONS
   When a customer mentions "cart", "add to cart", "remove", "checkout", or similar:
   - Parse their request to understand what products they want to add/remove
   - Update the cart state accordingly
   - Confirm the action taken
   - Show the updated cart contents

3. CART STATE MANAGEMENT
   You will receive:
   - RAW_IO_HISTORY: Complete conversation and cart state history
   - Current cart state
   - Customer's latest request

   You must return:
   - Updated cart as a JSON array
   - Conversational confirmation message
   - Any relevant product recommendations

4. PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS
   Based on cart contents, suggest:
   - Complementary products (e.g., if they added paint, suggest brushes, tape, drop cloths)
   - Related items frequently bought together
   - Products that complete a project

5. RESPONSE FORMAT
   Always respond in valid JSON format:
   {
       "answer": "Friendly confirmation message about what was added/removed",
       "cart": [
           {
               "product_id": "PROD-123",
               "name": "Product Name",
               "quantity": 2,
               "price": 29.99,
               "total": 59.98
           }
       ],
       "products": "Optional: Suggest related products here",
       "discount_percentage": "",
       "additional_data": ""
   }

6. CONVERSATION STYLE
   - Be friendly and helpful
   - Confirm actions clearly ("I've added 2 gallons of paint to your cart")
   - Provide cart summaries when asked
   - Suggest next steps ("Would you like to proceed to checkout?")
   - If unclear, ask for clarification

7. SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
   - If customer asks about cart but it's empty, acknowledge and suggest browsing products
   - If removing items, confirm which items were removed
   - If updating quantities, confirm the new quantity
   - Always maintain accurate cart state based on conversation history
   - Extract product information from the conversation context
   - On checkout, display the cart contents and tell the customer that they may pick up their products from the closest Zava retail outlet, located in Miami, Florida. Only give this information when the customer requests to check out.

Example interactions:

Customer: "Add the blue paint to my cart"
Response: {
    "answer": "I've added the blue paint to your cart! Would you also like to add paint brushes or painter's tape?",
    "cart": [{"product_id": "PAINT-BLUE-001", "name": "Blue Interior Paint", "quantity": 1, "price": 34.99, "total": 34.99}],
    "products": "Based on your paint selection, you might also need: Paint Brushes ($8.99), Painter's Tape ($5.99), Drop Cloth ($12.99)"
}

Customer: "What's in my cart?"
Response: {
    "answer": "You currently have 1 item in your cart: Blue Interior Paint (1 gallon) for $34.99. Your cart total is $34.99.",
    "cart": [{"product_id": "PAINT-BLUE-001", "name": "Blue Interior Paint", "quantity": 1, "price": 34.99, "total": 34.99}],
    "products": ""
}

Remember: Your goal is to make cart management seamless and helpful for customers!

### 03: Create agents in Microsoft Foundry

The next step in this task is to create five agents inside of Microsoft Foundry:

1. **Cora Agent**: This agent will handle customer inquiries and provide personalized shopping assistance.
1. **Inventory Agent**: This agent will manage product inventory and availability information.
1. **Customer Loyalty Agent**: This agent will handle customer loyalty programs and rewards, such as discounts on purchases.
1. **Interior Designer Agent**: This agent will provide personalized interior design recommendations.
1. **Cart Manager Agent**: This agent will manage the shopping cart operations.

The prompts for these agents are available in `src/prompts/`. The code to deploy the agents is in `src/app/agents`.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

First, navigate to [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) and select the AI project associated with this training.

Then, select the **Agents** tab from the left-hand menu.

Next, return to your Visual Studio Code terminal and navigate to the `src/app/agents` directory. Each agent has an initializer script that will create the appropriate agent in Microsoft Foundry. Run the following commands to create each of the five agents.

```bash
python customerLoyaltyAgent_initializer.py
python inventoryAgent_initializer.py
python interiorDesignAgent_initializer.py
python shopperAgent_initializer.py
python cartManagerAgent_initializer.py
```

As you create each agent, the script will output an Agent ID. Make a note of these IDs. There is a place in the .env file for each. Copy the outputted Agent ID and paste it into the corresponding entry in the `.env` file, specifically in the "Agent IDs" section. An example of an Agent ID is `asst_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. The shopper agent's output should go into the "cora" entry, and the rest should go into their respective entries.

After you have created all five agents, return to the Microsoft Foundry portal and verify that the agents have been created successfully. You should see all five agents listed in the Agents tab once you select the Refresh button.

</details>

### 04: Test the Cora agent

Microsoft Foundry includes a testing playground where you can interact with your agents and evaluate their performance. Because four of the five agents function by calling code that currently only exists locally, you will not be able to test all of their functionality in the playground. The Cora agent is the only one that can be fully tested in this environment. Write sample queries for the Cora agent to test its capabilities.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

To access the playground, select the Cora agent from the list. Then, select the **Try in playground** button on the right-hand side. In the playground, you will be able to chat with the Cora agent. Use the following prompts to get an idea of how the Cora agent behaves.

- "What are the latest trends in home decor?"
- "Can you help me find a sofa that fits my style?"
- "Do you have any blue paint in stock?"
- "What is the availability of the 'Modern Chair'?"
- "I am ready to check out."

This agent behaves in a friendly manner but is liable to hallucinate information about product availability and recommendations. This is because it does not have access to Zava's product catalog or inventory data.

</details>

### 05: Update the chat application

Now that you have created the agents in Microsoft Foundry, you will need to update the chat application to support these agents. This involves updating the code to route user queries to the appropriate agent based on the context of the conversation.

To do so, first, comment out **lines 45 and 250-256**, which deal with the single-agent example. A keyboard shortcut to comment out multiple lines in Visual Studio Code is to select the lines you want to comment (or uncomment) and then press `CTRL + /` on Windows or `CMD + /` on Mac.

Then, uncomment the relevant sections of code in `chat_app.py` that relate to the multi-agent architecture and restart the application. The relevant lines of code are **46-49** (import statements), **lines 117-118** (mounting the MCP server to your current application), **lines 127-138** (setting up the handoff service), and **lines 258-600** (handling service requests). The following block provides a somewhat detailed explanation of how the service request code works.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view solution</strong></summary>

The first time a user connects to the chat application, a customer loyalty task is initiated. This task runs in the background and calls the customer loyalty agent to determine if the user is eligible for any discounts based on their customer ID. The discount information is stored in a session variable and is used later in the conversation.

When the user sends a message, the chat application activates the handoff service (whose class definition is in `src/services/handoff_service.py`), calling the `classify_intent()` method. This method calls the GPT model and requests a structured output (currently only available in the beta API). The response includes a few attributes, including the domain of the user's query (e.g., interior design, inventory, cart management) and the reasoning behind the classification.

Based on the domain returned by the handoff service, the application routes the user's query to the appropriate agent. If the domain is "interior design," the query is sent to the interior designer agent. If the domain is "inventory," it is sent to the inventory agent. If the domain is "customer loyalty," it is sent to the customer loyalty agent. If the domain is "cart management," it is sent to the cart manager agent. If the domain is "cora," it is sent to the Cora agent. For each agent, the next step is to process an image if one is included in the user's message. If an agent needs to make product recommendations, the next call is to the `product_recommendations()` function, which queries Azure AI Search to retrieve relevant products based on the user's message.

After that, **lines 408-450** handle image creation, which is not officially covered in this training because the necessary model is only available upon request. However, if you have access to the `gpt-image-1` model, you can review this section of code to understand how image creation works.

Then, **lines 461-474** prepare the input for specific agents that have different needs. The cart manager agent needs to have the interaction history in order to define what is in the user's cart. The cora agent needs to have the conversation history for contextual dialogue. Finally, **lines 486-496** perform the actual call to the relevant agent.

In particular, **lines 487-496** retrieve and call the agent processor for the specific agent in question. The `AgentProcessor` class is defined in `src/app/agents/agent_processor.py`. This class handles the communication between the chat application and the Microsoft Foundry agents using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The processor includes a method called `run_conversation_with_text_stream()`, which communicates with the MCP server and streams the response back to the chat application via the MCP client.

From there, **lines 510-569** handle the response from the agent, including parsing the response, updating the current cart state, cleaning up the conversation history, saving any discount state, and sending the response back to the user.

</details>

### 06: Demonstrate application behavior

Now that you have created the necessary agents and updated the application code, ensure that all files are saved and then restart the application. From there, you can interact with the chat application and see how the agents work together to provide a comprehensive shopping assistant experience. Use the following prompts to test the application's behavior.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view solution</strong></summary>

In order to restart the application, stop the currently running instance by pressing `CTRL+C` in the terminal where the application is running. Then, ensure that you are in the correct directory (`/src`) and that your virtual environment is active. Finally, restart the application using the same command you used to start it initially: `uvicorn chat_app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.

Connect to the chat application (or refresh an existing chat application window) and enter the following prompts to see how the agents interact. Note that the context of the conversation will differ each time you run through this exercise, so the agents' responses may vary. For that reason, you may wish to modify the questions slightly to fit the context of your conversation.

1. What colors of green paint do you have?
2. I think I'm interested in Deep Forest. How many gallons would I need to paint a medium sized bedroom?
3. Let's add two gallons to the cart, please.
4. Please also add one paint tray and two of your All-Purpose Wall Paint Brushes.
5. What items are in my cart right now?

> The application also includes functionality to generate images based on user prompts. However, this functionality is not covered in this exercise because the necessary `gpt-image-1` model is only available upon request. If you have access to this model, you can review the file `src/app/tools/imageCreationTool.py` to understand how the image generation works. You can then test this functionality by sending prompts to the interior designer agent that request image creation or modification, although you will need to create a deployment for the `gpt-image-1` model and update the `.env` file accordingly.
